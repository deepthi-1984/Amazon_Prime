Amazon Prime Dashboard 📊🛍️🔍🎨🔧👨‍💻

##### The first objective was to comprehend the content available in various countries. I began by analyzing Amazon's data to gather information on the movies and TV shows accessible in each country.
##### The second objective involved identifying similar content through text analysis. After collecting the data, I analyzed the text descriptions of movies and TV shows. I employed text analysis techniques to determine content similarity by matching text-based features, helping us understand how content compares across different countries.
##### The fourth objective was to analyze performance indicators. I created performance indicators such as the number of actors, total ratings, the number of movies and TV shows, and the start and end years for each piece of content.
##### Additionally, I generated a graphical representation of ratings by category. This graphical representation provided insights into audience preferences.
##### Finally, I investigated whether Amazon Prime has shifted its focus towards TV shows over movies in recent years by analyzing historical data on the available content.
